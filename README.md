# Frontend Mentor - Bookmark landing page solution

This is a solution to the [Bookmark landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/bookmark-landing-page-5d0b588a9edda32581d29158).

[The Website](https://bookmark-landing-page5039.netlify.app/)

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

I don't have the figma file so it is not pixel perfect. I have tried to make similar as same as possible. The website is responsive only 1440px and 375px screen sizes. I'll be glad if you give me suggestion about mistakes, lackings and best practices and how can I fix it.
